Rio made his way to California via plane and has been the best parrot since he arrived. He\u2019s the sweetest most socialized parrot I\u2019ve ever had and I\u2019m in awe at how well behaved and intelligent (just three weeks here in his new home).

From the first time I visited your website, I instantly knew that you were not the average breeder. The love, attention, and dedication you and your family give to these babies are truly out of this world. They are all so gorgeous, kissable, extremely friendly, Smart and active. I knew when we picked up baby Chloe he would be cute and lovely\u2026but when you pulled the blanket off him to see my reaction, boy was I surprised. Not only was he even more gorgeous than we expected, he was so neat and breath taking!! Everyone who has seen him so far comment about his handsomeness (my mum keeps calling him my joy!!) I also want to thank you for going above and beyond to help us make it easier to ship him safely. It really showed me how much you really care about your clients as well and I appreciate how you have been guiding us by the hand through every step. The parrot kit was also SO sweet. So many gifts to help us start off with baby Mason the right way. We decided to keep his name as you have named him, as an honor to African Grey parrot Farm. I would highly recommend you guys to everyone looking for a great little companion that are spoiled with love and are bred by the best. You are going to have to send me your business cards since I know baby Chloe is going to stop everyone in their tracks. He is a treated as a prince in the family.

I went to see him and I got to meet the African Grey parrot farm breeders and their entire aviary and I new right away I wanted another. We brought Cookie home and two weeks later we had Mia. my neighbors could not withstand our parrots and immediately got theirs from them, African Grey parrot Farm are great breeders; African Grey parrot Farm parrot cares about their parrots and are very protective on where they go. African Grey parrot Farm has great quality and would not sell to just anyone. Cookie and Mia are by far the most awesome parrots I have ever owned. They are playful, they love my kids, they are very intelligent and Mia is an awesome leader. Cookie is my dominator but Mia is my leader (kinda weird) but that is who they are. we have recommended so many family and friends to them and all of them have adopted their parrots successfully ,If I were to buy another parrot, I would 100% go to African Grey parrot farm<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n          <\/div>\n          <div class=\"testimonial-meta pt-half\">\n             <strong class=\"testimonial-name test_name\"><\/strong>\n                          <span class=\"testimonial-company test_company\"><\/span>\n          <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n\n  \n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\n\t\n\n<\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"page-blank.php","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/africangreyparrotfarm.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1066"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/africangreyparrotfarm.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/africangreyparrotfarm.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/africangreyparrotfarm.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/africangreyparrotfarm.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1066"}],"version-history":[{"count":16,"href":"https:\/\/africangreyparrotfarm.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1066\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1082,"href":"https:\/\/africangreyparrotfarm.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1066\/revisions\/1082"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/africangreyparrotfarm.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1066"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
